This package has been made to make network epidemic models of COVID19 spread in refugee camps.

To install run:
```R
devtools::install_github('AIforGoodSimulator/network-model-R-package')
```

EpiModel has recently received an update and we have yet to test
the compatibility of our code with the newest version.
